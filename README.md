# Glendronach
Glendronach is an open source NVMe Driver for Window8 and above.
This driver is implemented by Storport miniport.
It is built with WindowSDK 10.0.20348 and WDK 10.0.20348.

I will try to support Win7 in future if I have time.
In Win7, NVMe driver should be implemented in SCSI miniport.
